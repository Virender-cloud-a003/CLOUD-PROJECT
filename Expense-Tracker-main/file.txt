The network graph is one of the useful features for developers on GitHub. It is used to display the branch history of the entire repository network, including branches of the root repository and branches of forks that contain commits unique to the network.
A repository's graphs give you information on traffic, projects that depend onthe repository, contributors and commits to the repository, and a repository's forks and network. If you maintain a repository, you can use this data to get abetter understanding of who's using your repository and why they're using it.
